                <p>Our inward power, when it obeys nature, reacts to events by accommodating itself to what it faces -
                    to what is possible. It needs no specific material. It pursues its own aims as circumstances allow;
                    it turns obstacles into fuel. As a fire overwhelms what would have quenched a lamp. What's thrown on
                    top of the conflagration is absorbed, consumed by it - and makes it burn still higher.</p>
